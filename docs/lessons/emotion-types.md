# Emotion Types

This project puts a focus on using MicroPython and OLED displays to generate [about seven primary emotions](https://www.paulekman.com/universal-emotions/).

Here are the seven faces that [Paul Ekman](https://www.paulekman.com/universal-emotions/) describes in his research:

1. happy
2. sad
3. angry
4. afraid
5. surprise
6. disgust
7. contempt

The feeling of tied or sleepy can also be shown on a robots face.

Here are photos of these seven emotions on people:

## Inside Out Emotions

The Pixar movie [Inside Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)) focused on only five
emotions in its characters:

1. Joy
2. Sadness
3. Fear
4. Disgust
5. Anger

Some of these emotions are easy for people to recognize.  Here is this list sorted by confidence
