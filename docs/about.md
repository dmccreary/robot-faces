# About The Robot Faces Book

The book is designed to be a fun way to teach concepts in computational thinking.  It was designed to use low-cost parts to keep robot kits as low as possible.  Most classrooms can create projects for under $35 per robot if you purchase parts in a quantity of 10.

## Primary Goals

1. Create hands-on lessons that are fun for students
2. Teach fundamentals of computational thinking such as abstractions, functions and modularity
3. Get students to think about how faces are used to communicate emotions
